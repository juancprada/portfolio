            <h5>Web App Concept &middot; UX/UI Design</h5>
            <h5>Course Project at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.acamica.com/">Ac&aacute;mica</a></h5>

            <p><strong>Vibe</strong> is a web/app concept I designed during the UX/UI Design course I took at <strong>Ac&aacute;mica</strong>. Its goal is to help people find housing/roommates in the city of Bogot&aacute;, Colombia.</p>
            <p>Users would be able to join the community as hosts or roommates. Using their profile information, the platform provides them with suggestions that are suited to their needs or preferences, allowing them to easily find their perfect match.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="project-content">

          <img src="../assets/images/project_vibe_01.png" alt="Logo design for Vibe">
          <p class="caption">The brand’s logotype design combines two different styles of typography. The end result is clean and simple, with a bit of a playful vibe (pun intended).</p>

          <div class="main-info">
            <p class="big-text big-text-space">
            Every year, people from all over the country arrive to Bogot&aacute; looking for new opportunities. But, more often than not, they find themselves lacking the means to rent an appartment or a house by themselves, as it can be quite expensive, depending on where they want to live.
            </p>

            <p class="big-text big-text-space">
            In that sense, co-living presents itself not only as an alternative to find affordable housing, but also as a way for them to meet and connect with new people, which would also help them in the process of adapting to the dynamics of a big city.
            </p>

            <p class="big-text">
            As I intended to promote this concept as a new way of living, I tried to reflect that in the brand name, which comes from the spanish word “vive” (live, in english), but modified to become something different (while referencing the english slang “vibe” at the same time).
            </p>
          </div>

          <img src="../assets/images/project_vibe_02.png" alt="Proposed homepage for Vibe">
          <p class="caption">Vibe’s homepage. I used textures, bright colors and different kinds of shapes to give the project an expressive and youthful look and feel.</p>

          <div class="main-info">
            <p class="big-text">
            Whether they need a place to live, or have a spare room at home to rent, users can find suitable matches through a system of filters. Should they need additional information before sending a request, a contact option is available.
            </p>
          </div>

          <img src="../assets/images/project_vibe_03.png" alt="Vibe's search section">
          <p class="caption">Search section of the site, both for roommates and hosts. Filters are presented through a sidebar.</p>

          <img class="add-space" src="../assets/images/project_vibe_04.png" alt="Roommate and rooms ads">
          <p class="caption">This is how ads look like in the platform. Roommates will include their budget and details of what they’re looking for, while hosts will promote their spaces and provide relevant information (monthy price, location, ammenities, etc). In both cases, the user profile of the ad owner will be visible.</p>

          <div class="main-info">
            <p class="big-text">
            Once the desktop version of the site was completed and prototyped, I designed an Android app (as it is the most used mobile OS in Colombia), using the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://material.io/">Material</strong></a> design system as a guide.
